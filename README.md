# Alfred.app + Git = Cloning Greatness #

## Installation & Setup ##

First, Download the extension to somewhere on your computer. 
Second, hunt down the pesky extension and give it a good old double clicking! When prompted, save the extension.

If you are on OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion you should see an icon next to the Command: section, this means the extension will use Notification Centre to tell you when it's run.

Don't close preferences Just yet!

By default any Git repository you clone will download to your Desktop folder
### Optional Modifications

By default the extension clones all of your repositories to your Desktop folder, should you want to change this location you need to:

Open Alfred's preferences and navigate to the extension, find the text `~/Desktop` in the Command: field and replace it with `~/Dropbox/repositories/`.

Click save and you're all set!



## Usage

1. Invoke Alfred and type the keyword `cloning`, leave a space and paste the URL of the repository into Alfred.
2. After a short time you should get a message from Notification Centre telling you all went well, obviously how long it takes is dependent on the size of the repository.
3. So, if you wanted to clone the repository containing this extension you would type this into Alfred:

	cloning git://github.com/escapefromthebluebedroom/alfred-clone-git-repository.git

6. Do some breakthrough cloning work
